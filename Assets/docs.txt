A simple txt to define the folder Assets as a folder with specific assets made for the game "Hardest Idle Game". These assets are not free for distribution and purchase options are available.

You may purchase the download through Patreon which is helpfully provided in a file named "patreon.txt" in the master directory of these files. I will be adding more each day so check back for bug
fixes etc.

THIS FILE MAY ALSO BE UPDATED SO EVERY UPDATE YOU SEE IN THIS REPOITORY MAKE SURE TO CHECK BACK TO THIS FILE.
